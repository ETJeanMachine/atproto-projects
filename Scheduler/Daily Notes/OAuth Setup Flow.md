I want users to just enter in their username - I don't think this will work. Maybe what I'll do is:
- Authenticate against known PDS's first
- If those fail, then prompt the user for their custom PDS (?)
- Always include the option to enter in their PDS
None of this is necessary nvm! I only need the PDS.
